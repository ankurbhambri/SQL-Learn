Which says for every user, give me all of the events from the last 7 days, 
and then extract the number of days old each event is, 
and then count the number of distinct number of days there are. 
But this was a mistake because I misunderstood two things:

The week window always begins on Monday, rather than having a rolling last-7-days. 
The week starts every week on Monday. If it is currently Wednesday, 
the maximum Lness for a user this week is 3, and tomorrow it is 4. 
Likewise, you will only see 7â€™s on Sunday. I want to see historically how the Lness was in prior weeks.
